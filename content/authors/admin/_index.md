Final year Undergrad student pursuing Bachelor's in Technology from Jamia Millia Islamia. Currently working as AI Research Intern at MixOrg Private Limited. I have a good knowledge of ML and DL, and I aspire to work as a Research Associate in the field. My goal in life is to contribute something so unique to the field that people know it by my name, just like we have LeNets named after Yann LeCun. I have done a fair amount of projects that support my skills in the field, and demonstrate my expertise too. I wish I knew enough Web Development to create a portfolio of my own.
